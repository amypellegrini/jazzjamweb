description: Use whenever the user asks to assess a repo's quality posture — `/qa` runs a full sweep (test pyramid, CI coverage, pre-commit hygiene) and consolidates the findings, `/qa <dimension>` runs a single assessment. Also responds to "QA agent" / "QA" aliases in natural-language requests. Routes to the `qa` subagent, which composes the QA assessment skills (assess-test-pyramid, assess-ci, assess-pre-commit) with load-bearing discipline: the quality-bar gate (surface the project's own standard rather than imposing generic defaults), a strict read-only constraint (reports and recommendations only), graceful degradation on missing skills, and auditable point-in-time reports under .sensible-harness/reports/.

# QA orchestrator

Slash-command entry point for assessing a repo's quality posture — test distribution, CI coverage, pre-commit hygiene — and consolidating the findings into one auditable read. This skill is a routing layer; the actual assessment composition, gates, and reporting are owned by the `qa` subagent (`.claude/agents/qa.md`). Keep this file thin so the two surfaces never drift.

## Routing

Spawn the `qa` subagent via the Agent tool, passing the user's input plus a one-line shape hint. Pick the shape from the arguments:

- `/qa` (no arguments) → **Full sweep**. The subagent runs every installed assessment skill, applies the quality-bar gate per dimension, and consolidates the results into a single quality summary.
- `/qa <dimension>` (e.g. `test-pyramid`, `ci`, `pre-commit`) → **Targeted assessment**. Pass the dimension. The subagent runs that single static assessment and reports.
- `/qa <issue ref>` (e.g. `#41`, a bare number, or a Jira key) → **Feature verification**. Pass the issue reference. The subagent invokes `qa-test`: check out the feature branch, build a test plan from the issue's ACs, post it to the issue, run the feature, and post a close/address-gaps assessment to the PR. (Directly invocable as `/qa-test #N` too.)
- `/qa <free-text>` (e.g. "is our test pyramid healthy?") → **Ask / route**. The subagent maps the request to a shape (assessment vs. feature verification), asking via `AskUserQuestion` if the mapping is ambiguous.

If the argument is genuinely ambiguous, ask the user via AskUserQuestion before dispatching — don't guess.

## What the subagent owns (do not duplicate here)

- The QA skill composition: static assessments (`assess-test-pyramid`, `assess-ci`, `assess-pre-commit`) consolidated into one read, plus dynamic feature verification (`qa-test`).
- The load-bearing discipline: the quality-bar gate (surface the project's own standard before judging; never silently impose generic defaults), the read-only-on-code constraint (recommend fixes, never apply them — that's `/dev`), graceful degradation on missing skills, and auditable point-in-time reporting under `.sensible-harness/reports/`. For feature verification, `qa-test`'s issue and PR comments are its deliverable and go out autonomously (the clean-tree check before branch checkout is the one destructive-action gate).
- Graceful degradation when a required assessment skill isn't installed — surface the install command (`sensible-harness <skill>`) and skip that dimension (full sweep) or stop (targeted run).
- Reporting back: per-dimension verdict and report path, quality-bar status per dimension, assessments skipped for missing skills, and top diagnoses.

## Why the split

The agent definition is the canonical behavioural spec. Both invocation paths — `/qa …` and natural-language ("QA agent, please assess the test pyramid") — route to the same instructions, so there is one source of truth and no drift between the slash command and the subagent.

## Cursor

Cursor has no subagent equivalent today. Cursor users invoking this rule should follow the workflow inline by reading `.claude/agents/qa.md` — same composition, same gates, but executed by the primary agent rather than spawned into its own context.
