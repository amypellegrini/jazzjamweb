# Commit conventions

Apply these rules whenever creating a git commit.

## Atomic commits

One concern per commit. If the staged changes mix concerns — scaffolding + behavior, refactor + feature, two unrelated fixes, docs + code — unstage and split before committing.

- Inspect what's staged before writing a message: `git diff --cached --stat`. Group files by what they change; if there's more than one group, split.
- Mixed staging recovery: `git restore --staged <paths>` to unstage, then re-`git add` by concern and commit each group separately.
- A failing pre-commit hook means the commit did *not* land. Fix the underlying issue, re-stage, and create a NEW commit. Do not `git commit --amend` after a failed hook — that modifies the *previous* commit and can destroy work.

## Conventional Commits 1.0.0

Format: `<type>[optional scope]: <subject>`

Spec: <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/>

### Types in use here

| Type | When to use |
|---|---|
| `feat` | New user-visible capability |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `chore` | Maintenance, tooling, deps; no production behavior change |
| `docs` | Documentation only (`README`, `SPEC`, `CLAUDE.md`, skills) |
| `test` | Tests only |
| `refactor` | Internal restructure with no behavior change |
| `build` | Build system, package config (`tsconfig.json`, `package.json` deps) |
| `ci` | CI pipeline only |

### Subject line

- Imperative mood: "add", not "added" / "adds" / "adding".
- Lower-case after the colon.
- ≤72 characters.
- No trailing period.

### Body (when needed)

- Explain *why*, not *what* — the diff already shows what.
- Wrap at ~72 columns.
- Reference the iteration, design doc, or constraint that motivated the change only when it isn't obvious from context.

## Examples

Good:

- `feat: add sensible-harness doctor subcommand`
- `fix: handle missing package.json in version banner`
- `docs: clarify the three-step setup in SPEC`
- `test: add smoke test for built binary`
- `chore(deps): bump typescript to 5.7`

Bad — and why:

- `Updates` — no type, vague subject.
- `feat: Added new feature` — past tense, capitalized after colon, vague.
- `fix bug` — no colon, no useful subject.
- `chore: tweaks and fixes` — non-atomic ("and" usually signals two concerns).
