description: Use whenever the user asks to assess the test pyramid, audit test distribution, check for ice-cream-cone or hourglass anti-patterns, or generate a static report on the unit/integration/e2e balance. First locates the project's own test-pyramid definition (TESTING.md, CONTRIBUTING.md testing section, ADR, etc.) — recommends creating one if absent. Then classifies each test against the project's layer definitions, computes percentages, and emits a self-contained HTML report at .sensible-harness/reports/test-pyramid-<timestamp>.html with an auditable per-test classification table and threshold-driven recommendations.

# Assess test pyramid

Scan this repo's test suite, classify each test by pyramid layer, compute the percentage breakdown, and emit an HTML report at `.sensible-harness/reports/test-pyramid-<timestamp>.html`. The report's purpose is to surface anti-patterns ("ice cream cone", "hourglass") at a glance and hand the team auditable per-test classifications they can disagree with.

This is **static classification only** — do not run the tests. Cover the host project's primary language; if the repo is multi-language, ask the user which language to assess and document the choice in the report.

## 1. Locate the project's test-pyramid definition

Before classifying anything, find the document that defines what counts as each layer **for this project**. Each codebase has its own conventions — what "integration" means here, where the boundary sits, what runtime each layer is allowed to touch. Don't impose generic definitions; impose the project's own.

Look for, in order:

- A dedicated `TESTING.md`, `docs/testing.md`, `docs/test-pyramid.md`, `docs/testing/pyramid.md`, or similar.
- A "Testing", "Test pyramid", or "Test layers" section in `CONTRIBUTING.md` or `README.md`.
- An ADR (`docs/adr/*`, `docs/decisions/*`) that pins the test layers.
- Project-internal conventions referenced from `package.json` `scripts`, `pytest.ini`, or test-runner config files (sometimes the layer mapping lives there as a comment).

**If you find a definition:**

- Summarise the layer names and definitions back to the user before scanning. Confirm you've parsed it correctly.
- Use the project's layer names (don't translate "component" → "integration" silently — preserve the project's vocabulary in the report).
- Apply the project's folder / framework / runtime mappings as the **primary** classification signal. The heuristics in §3 become an internal toolset for *applying* those mappings, plus a fallback for tests the doc doesn't pin.

**If you don't find a definition:**

- **Stop and recommend creating one before generating a report.** Without project-specific definitions, the classification is guesswork dressed up as data, and the report will mislead.
- Offer to draft a starter pyramid doc at `docs/test-pyramid.md` based on the test runners and folder layout you observe — capturing what's there today as the documented baseline rather than inventing new conventions.
- The user may explicitly opt to proceed without a definition (e.g. "just give me a rough read"). If so:
  - Use the generic heuristics in §3 as the sole signal.
  - Mark this in the report header: "No project test-pyramid definition found; classified using generic heuristics."
  - Surface the offer to draft `docs/test-pyramid.md` again at the end.

## 2. Discover the test suite

Defer to the host project's existing convention. Look for, in order:

- A `test/`, `tests/`, `__tests__/`, or `spec/` directory at the repo root.
- A test runner declared in `package.json` (`scripts.test`, `vitest.config.*`, `jest.config.*`, `playwright.config.*`) — follow its `testMatch` / `testDir` if specified.
- For Python: `pytest.ini`, `pyproject.toml` `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`, or `tests/`.
- For Go: `_test.go` files alongside source.
- For Rust: `tests/` directory and `#[cfg(test)]` blocks.

If multiple plausible locations exist (e.g. both `test/` and `tests/`), or no obvious convention, **ask the user** before scanning. Do not silently pick.

## 3. Classify each test

When the project has a pyramid definition (§1), apply *its* mappings first — folder rules, framework rules, runtime constraints, layer names — and use the heuristics below only to fill gaps the doc doesn't address.

When proceeding without a project definition (user opt-in only), apply these heuristics in order — the first that fires wins:

1. **File path** — strongest signal.
   - Path contains `/unit/` or `.unit.` → **unit**.
   - Path contains `/integration/`, `/int/`, or `.integration.` → **integration**.
   - Path contains `/e2e/`, `/end-to-end/`, `.e2e.`, `/playwright/`, or `/cypress/` → **e2e**.

2. **Framework signal** — declared imports / runners.
   - Imports `@playwright/test`, `cypress`, `puppeteer`, or `selenium-webdriver` → **e2e**.
   - Imports `supertest`, `testcontainers`, or boots a real database / HTTP server → **integration**.
   - Pure `vitest` / `jest` / `node:test` / `pytest` / Go `testing` / Rust `#[test]` with no integration signals → **unit** (provisional; later heuristics may reclassify).

3. **Test description / `describe` prefix** — `describe("e2e: …")`, `describe("integration: …")`, `it.skip("[unit] …")`, etc. Only use this when the path and framework signals are ambiguous.

4. **Test duration**, when available from a recent test report. Long-running tests (multi-second) are usually integration or e2e; sub-millisecond tests are usually unit. Treat as a tiebreaker only.

### Resolving ambiguity

When stacked heuristics give conflicting signals, or no signal lands cleanly: **ask the user**. Show the file and the conflicting signals; let them pick the layer.

**Default fallback** (use only when the user is unavailable, e.g. non-interactive runs): classify as **unit**. Surface every fallback decision in the report's classification table so the user can audit and correct.

## 4. Compute percentages

Total = number of test cases (not test files). For each layer, percentage = `count / total * 100`, rounded to one decimal place. If the suite has zero tests, write a report that says so explicitly and skip the recommendations section.

Use the project's layer names where a definition exists. Otherwise default to `unit` / `integration` / `e2e`.

## 5. Generate the HTML report

Write to `.sensible-harness/reports/test-pyramid-<timestamp>.html` where `<timestamp>` is a filesystem-safe ISO-like value (e.g. `2026-05-08T14-30-00Z`). Create the directory if missing — it's gitignored.

The report **must contain** these sections, in this order:

1. **Header** — project name (from `package.json` / `pyproject.toml` / fallback to repo dir name), generation timestamp, total test count, and the source of the layer definitions (e.g. "Layer definitions: `docs/test-pyramid.md`" or "No project test-pyramid definition found; classified using generic heuristics.").
2. **Distribution** — percentage per layer, rendered as a horizontal bar (CSS only, no external assets) and a small table. Make the bar visually obvious — pyramid health is the headline.
3. **Recommendations** — derived from the thresholds below. If the distribution is healthy, say so explicitly.
4. **Per-test classification table** — every test, with columns: file path, test name, classified layer, signal that triggered the classification (e.g. "doc: `tests/integration/` rule", "path: /e2e/", "framework: @playwright/test", "user: confirmed", "fallback: default"). This is the auditable artifact; do not omit it.

The HTML must be self-contained: inline `<style>`, no external scripts, no CDN dependencies. It should open correctly via `file://` in any modern browser.

## 6. Apply the recommendation thresholds

If the project's pyramid definition includes its own thresholds or target distribution (e.g. "we aim for 70/20/10"), use those — preserve the team's stated targets in the report. Otherwise, fall back to these generic rules:

| Condition | Diagnosis | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Base layer ≥ 60% | Healthy base | Maintain; no action. |
| Base layer < 30% | Thin foundation | Expand base-layer coverage of pure logic before adding higher-layer tests. |
| Top layer > 30% | Ice cream cone | Push tests down — convert top-layer assertions into mid- / base-layer where possible. |
| Mid layer < 10% AND top layer ≥ 10% | Hourglass / gap | Fill the middle layer — likely paying top-layer flake costs for behaviour a mid-layer test would cover faster. |

The "base / mid / top" terminology maps to the project's layer names — translate when emitting the report. Multiple conditions can fire simultaneously; list each diagnosis separately.

## 7. Out of scope (do not do these)

- **Don't run the tests.** No `npm test`, `pytest`, etc. Static classification only.
- **Don't change the test code** — no auto-generation of unit tests, deletion of e2e tests, refactors. Recommendations only.
- **Don't compare to a previous report.** Point-in-time analysis only; trend tracking is a separate concern.
- **Don't compute coverage.** That's a different signal and a different skill.
- **Don't classify across languages in a single report.** Ask the user to pick one language for multi-language repos.
- **Don't invent layer definitions** when the project doesn't have one. Recommend creating one instead.

## 8. After writing the report

Tell the user:

- The exact path of the report.
- The source of the layer definitions (project doc path, or "generic heuristics — no project definition found").
- The headline distribution using the project's layer names (e.g. "Unit 42% / Integration 8% / E2E 50%").
- Top diagnosis if any (e.g. "Ice cream cone — top layer exceeds 30%.").
- That the per-test classification table is auditable and they should challenge any rows that look wrong.

Do **not** open the file in a browser automatically; just print the path.
